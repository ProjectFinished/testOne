                        "Personally, I started my photography journey during a required photo class in college. Once I began to capture scenes around the city of Syracuse New York I knew this is a skill I wanted to master. Now I spend most of my time capturing the lives and landscapes of cities across America."

                <p class="ReferenceBox"> “There is one thing the photo must contain, the humanity of the moment.” Robert Frank</p>
                <p class="ReferenceBox"> “Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever… It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything.” Aaron Siskind</p>
                <p class="ReferenceBox"> “When you photograph people in color, you photograph their clothes. But when you photograph people in Black and white, you photograph their souls!” Ted Grant</p>
                <p class="ReferenceBox"> For me black and white is a purer image which allows greater drama and more expression, be it a portrait or a landscape.” Antonia Deutsch</p>
